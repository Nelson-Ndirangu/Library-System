## üîó Relationships

* **Member ‚Üî Book**: A member can borrow multiple books.
* **Member ‚Üî BorrowTransaction**: Each transaction belongs to a specific member.
* **Book ‚Üî BorrowTransaction**: Each transaction involves one book.
* **Librarian ‚Üî BorrowTransaction**: Each transaction is officiated by exactly one librarian.

---

## üöÄ Usage

* Import the schema into **MySQL Workbench** or run the SQL script in a MySQL server.
* Extend the schema by adding **categories, reservations, or fines** if needed.

---

## üìÑ Notes

* Dates are stored as `DATE`/`DATETIME` for tracking transactions and duties.
* `member_id` in **Book** is optional; it indicates which member currently has the book checked out.
* Ensure **foreign keys** are enforced for data consistency.

Would you like me to also **generate the SQL CREATE TABLE statements** for this exact schema so you can run it directly in MySQL?
